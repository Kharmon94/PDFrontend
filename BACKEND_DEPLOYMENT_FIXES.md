# Backend Deployment Fixes Applied

## Changes Made to Fix Railway Deployment

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Port Configuration
**File:** `preferred_deals_api/Dockerfile`
- Changed `EXPOSE 80` to `EXPOSE $PORT`
- Updated CMD to use `$PORT` environment variable: `CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "$PORT"]`

### 2. Updated Production SSL Configuration
**File:** `preferred_deals_api/config/environments/production.rb`
- Disabled `config.force_ssl = false` for Railway deployment
- Railway handles SSL termination, so Rails doesn't need to force SSL

### 3. Enhanced CORS Configuration
**File:** `preferred_deals_api/config/initializers/cors.rb`
- Added Railway domain patterns: `/.*\.railway\.app$/`, `/.*\.railway\.dev$/`
- This allows frontend requests from Railway domains

### 4. Created Deployment Scripts
**Files:** `deploy-backend.sh` (Linux/Mac) and `deploy-backend.bat` (Windows)
- Automated deployment process
- Checks for Railway CLI installation
- Handles project linking

## What These Fixes Address

1. **Port Issues**: Railway assigns dynamic ports via `$PORT` environment variable
2. **SSL Conflicts**: Prevents SSL redirect loops on Railway
3. **CORS Errors**: Allows frontend-backend communication across Railway domains
4. **Deployment Process**: Streamlines the deployment workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment** using the deployment script:
   - Windows: Run `deploy-backend.bat`
   - Linux/Mac: Run `./deploy-backend.sh`

2. **Monitor the deployment** in Railway dashboard

3. **Update frontend API URL** once backend is deployed

4. **Test the full application** end-to-end

## Expected Results

- ✅ Rails backend builds successfully
- ✅ Database migrations run automatically
- ✅ Health check endpoint `/up` responds correctly
- ✅ Frontend can communicate with backend API
- ✅ Full application works on Railway

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway dashboard for build logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure PostgreSQL service is provisioned
4. Check that all dependencies are properly configured
